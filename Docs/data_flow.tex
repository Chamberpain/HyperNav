\section{Introduction}
The Hypernav project proposes to seed the worlds oceans with Lagrangian hyper-spectral cameras based on the Argo platform \citep{roemmich2019future}, and offers an innovative means to validate the PACE satellite \citep{frouin2019atmospheric}. Floats built on the Argo platform are not Lagrangian drifters in the truest sense. They each are equipped with a small buoyancy engine which allows them to profile the water column while collecting ocean measurements, surface and broadcast those measurements, and then descend and drift at the so called "parking depth". The ideal parking depth is the goal this study aims to determine. Previous ocean color validation experiments have deployed instrumented moorings \citep{clark2003moby} to measure and transmit optical properties of the ocean. Instrumented moorings are typically expensive and difficult to maintain and require complicated logistics to deploy globally because of their vastly greater size and weight; Lagrangian drifters on the other hand are typically less expensive than moorings and can be deployed by one or two people from the deck of almost any ship. Because of this scalability, proposals have been considered to deploy a distributed network of Hypernav drifters globally to allow for multiple validation locations as opposed to the one or two validation moorings that have been used to validate previous generations of ocean color satellites. This is not to say that Lagrangian drifters do not suffer from their own drawbacks. Drifters inherently move about with ocean currents; this is problematic for two reasons: firstly, instrumented drifters are fragile and cannot survive groundings. Care must be taken to navigate drifters at depths such that they avoid the ocean floor. Secondly, the regions of ideal satellite validations are relatively small. If Hypernav floats drift too far, their observations will not be useful for satellite validation. To address these challenges, we combine 2 technologies - a 4D prediction of currents in the Hawaiian Islands \citep{PacIOOS}, and a an open source particle trajectory prediction software package \citep{delandmeter2019parcels} - to produce an almost real time estimate of float trajectories at 8 depth levels that can be used to reprogram an instrument to drift at an ideal depth during its mission. The ideal park depth for this study is the depth at which the float has simultaneously the lowest probability of grounding. The software package presented in this work is configured for the Hawaiian Islands, but this technique could be generally applied to any mission using the Argo platform.
