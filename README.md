# HyperNav
Code for Hypernav Trajectory Prediction


An additional module of code is required to run this package called "General Utilities". You should have been added as a collaborator to that other repository when you were made a collaborator on this repository. Please download that other repository as well. 

Place the General Utilities and Hypernav folders in a master folder. The name of the master folder doesn't matter, but mine is called projects. 
Then modify your python path to point to this master folder. A good explanation on how to do this is here 
(https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3402168/permanently-add-a-directory-to-pythonpath)
The process for doing this on each operating system is a little different, but there are stack overflow articles that support all OS'.
